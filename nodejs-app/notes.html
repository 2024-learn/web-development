Modules in JS
    - same as JS libraries

Express
    - A web application framework
    - provides a set of features for web apps
    - helps to manage a server and routes
    - `npm install express`

require()
    - to include a module in your app
    - similar to import

Different variable declarations:
    var 
    - value can be updated.
    - the only way before the new JS version was added to better alternatives

    const
    - introduced with the second major revison of JS
    - value cannot be updated
    - the preferred way if the variable will not and should not be updated

    let
    - introduced with the 2nd version of JS
    - value can be updated
    - better version of var because it helps prevent errors

Semicolons(optional)
    - lets the compiler know it has reached the end of a command
    - optional, because they will be inserted automatically in JS
    - for conistency: either ALWAY use it or NEVER use it

app.listen()
    - starts a server
    - which listens for connections on the specified host and port
    - starts our backend application and makes it available
    - there are two parameters that the listen function expects:
        - on which port the app should listen
        - what the app should do when receiving the HTTP request

node
    - we use node command to start our nodeJS app
    - `node server.js`
    - * also start and restart application when you make changes to the server.js file since it does not reload like in Vue


localhost
    - the hostname or the computer that is currently in use to run the program
    - so it means "this" computer in a network
    - used for testing purposes in development, not actual production

ports
    - ports are virtual places within an OS, where network connections start and end
    - every machine has a range of ports available
    - these ports can be allocated to different applications
    - every app/service runs and is available on a specific port, 
        making it possible to identify and address a specific application on the machine

http protocol
    - system of rules that define how data is exchanged
    - index.html is the entrypoint of every application
    - the backend that serves the index.html file is also called the server application becasue it serves the response
    - the browser that makes the request is also called the client
    - http is about communication between web clients and servers
    - client sends the http request, server sends the response

    - the browser only requests what is referenced in the index.html or subsequent html files

backend responsibilities
    - get and save data in database
    - execute heavy logic/ data processing / validation
    - receive requests from clients and send requested data back : acting as a web server

URL(Uniform Resource Locator)
    - also colloquially called "web address"
    - URI- uniform resource Identifier


    app.use('/', './public')
    / function listening(){
    //    console.log("node app is listening on port 3000")
    // } 
    app.use('/', express.static(__dirname + '/'))

// function listening(){
//     console.log("node app is listening on port 3000")
// }
    - built-in function that serves static files
__dirname
    - variable that gives you the absolute path of the directory containing the currently executing file

HTTP response status codes
    - indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been succesfully completed
        - 200   request succeeded
        - 304   not modified: indicates to the browser that there is no need to retransmit the 
                requested resources
                it's an implicit redirection to a cached resource
        - 404   server cannit find the requested resource
    - responses are grouped in five classes
        informational responses: 100-199
        successful responses:    200-299
        redirection messages:    300-399
        client error responses:  400-499
            - bad request from client. client or user has to fix an error before trying again
              e.g. - request for a non-existent resource (404 - not found)
                  - user entered some invalid data (400 - bad request)
                  - not allowed to perform this action (403 - forbidden)
        server error responses:  500-599
            - valid request was made by the client byt the server failed to complete the request
                - there is a problem with the backend
            e.g. - 500 - internal server error
                       - best to retry

JSON
    - easy syntax, human- readable text
    - JS can easily convert JSON data into JS objects
        JSON.parse():       convert to JS object
        JSON.stringify():   convert JS object into JSON string
    - each programming language has its own syntax
    - all applications no matter their programming language can exchange data using JSON

HTTP Messages(Request and Responses) consist of Header and Body
    - metadata is in the HTTP header
    - "payload" is the information or data sent in the HTTP message body

fetch()
    - provides an easy to fetch resources acoss the network
    - parameters: 
        - the endpoint/URL on which we want to talk to the backend
            Endpoint:
                - A web address(URL) at which the clients can gain access to the app
                - we can create our own endpoints in the backend. e.g. to-do-tasks
                - usually comes after the slash. eg. http://localhost:3000/to-do-tasks
        - an object that contains some configuration about the HTTP request
            - HTTP requests and responses need to have a specific format
    - fetch abstracts away the complexity
        - we only need to configure a few things, and the rest is handled by the fetch method; 
          and there are also default values which are set by the browser itself

HTTP Methods
    - used to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource
    - the most important ones are:
        - GET:      retrieve or get data
        - POST:     send data to the server
        - PUT:      update/replace data
        - PATCH:    update/modify data
        - DELETE:   delete data

HTTP header
    - adds additional context and metadata about the request or the response
        - headers: {
                    'Accept': 'application/json',
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
                }
            (meaning we are sending the data in json and expecting the data back in JSON)

await
    - fetch() is unlike the other functions we have written so far. It is an asynchronous function
    - sometimes the http request might be slow or the backend is unavailable or that the request is taking a while to process. 
        - it might take a while to receive the ersponse
        - we do not want it to wait for the response and block the UI;
          the user should be able to continue using the website.
            - use case: imagine uploading a photo to social media. 
                If that photo takes a while to post to the backend, and the fetch() was synchronous, 
                then your app would freeze while that request is being processed before you can proceed
    
        Synchronous vs. Asynchronous
        - synchronous calls are blocking.
        - the request must complete before the browser can continue with the execution

        - Asynchronous calls or requests are non blocking
        - tasks can run simultaneously

    Handling the "promise" with async/await
        - a "promise" is an onject representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchromous operation
        - you receive a "promise" immediately, not the actual response
        - with await keyword, the actual response is assigned to out variable once the request completes
        - you can store the await into a variable called res or response

    You cannot use an Async() within a sync(). The parent also has to be asynch()

Create the HTTP endpoint in backend
    Adding a new endpoint or route
        - route definition takes the followinf structure:
          app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)
        - where;
            - app is a instance of express
            - METHOD is an HTTP request method, in lower case
            - PATH is a path on the server
            - HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched
                request handler:
                - a function, which is executed whenever a request is received on the specified path.
                - it has two parameters:
                    - to handle the request, 2 parameters are provided: the request and response object
    
    app.post('/save-task', function(req, res) {}) -> will get executed whenever a POST request is sent to this endpoint

response object
    - the res object exposes several functions that let you configure and send a response to an HTTP request
    - res.send() is the most basic way to send an HTTP response

body-parser module
    - extracts the body protion of an incoming request and parses the JSOn data and exposes it on req.body
    - parsing: translating from one format to another

app.use(middleware)
    - app.use() lets you register middleware or a chain of middleware
    - these are executed before the end route (app.get, app.post, etc.)
    - so middleware is basically at teh very entrance to the backend
    - every request will actually go through this middleware

Get data from the backend
    onload Event
        - event occurs when an object has been loaded
        - adding it on the body element executes JS immediately after a page has been loaded
