<!-- 
    <style> element
    - used to define style (CSS) information for a document
    How it works:
    Which element you want to style         How to style it
    - div elements                          - Should have this width
    - h1 elements                           - Should have this color and size
    
    CSS Syntax
    - p = the selector: points to the HTML element you want to style
    - the declaration block: containing one or more style declarations, that should be applied on the HTML element(s)
    - each declaration includes a CSS property name and value: color is a property, grey is the property value

    Border property
    - shorthand syntax for: border width, border-style, border-color
        - border: 1px solid black;

    Margin property
    - used to create space around the elements; outside of any defined borders
    - margin can also be set individually: margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, margin-bottom. 
        - Done clockwise from top (top, right, bottom, left)
        - margin: 10px 5px 10px, 5px;
        - margin: 5px
        - margin: 10px 5px

    id selector:
    - #logo-img {width: 300px;}
    - instead of globally changing all values of an element, you can adjust the elements individually with an id attribute.
    - uses the id attribute of an HTML element to sepect a specific element
    - Hash (#) character is used to select element by id
    - note: No two id elements should have the same id

    class selector:
    - Uses the class attribute of an HTML element to select HTML elements
    - Dot(.) character is used to select elements by class

<!-- 
    Website Layout
    - there are many different layouts, but the following structure is very common:
    - Header, Navigation bar(about, links to other main pages, etc), Aside, main section/content, footer

    how to style with CSS
    - using float, width and other positioning
    flexbox layout:
        - you work with a flex cotainer and flex items
        - makes it easier to design flexible responsive designs
    grid layout:
        - grid-based layout system, with rows and columns
        - also makes it easier to design flexible web pages

    parent element(container)
    - this div should become a flexible container
    flex items(child elements)
    - define the flex-direction

    Different versions of Flexbox
    - like any language, CSS is developed and improved by its maintainers
        - display: box; a version of 2009
        - display: flexbox; a version of 2011
        - display: flex: actual version
    - the value was changed when a new specification was released
    - flex is the latest one

    - default layout is rows
        flex-direction: row;
    - to define in columns: flex-direction: column;
    
    justify-content attribute
    - with this you can align the flex ittems horizontally

    Attributed for parent and child containers
    Attributes for the parent container
    The flex container properties are:
    - flex-direction
    - flex-wrap
    - flex-flow
    - justiy-content
    - align-items
    - align content

    Attributes for the child container
    The flex container properties are:
    - order
    - flex-grow
    - flex-shrink
    - flex-basis
    - flex
    - align-self

    flex-grow attribute:
    - defines how much space it should take relative to the rest of the flex items/child elements
    - value is a number. Default is 0
    - example: 1, 1, 5
        - 3rd item "grows" five times faster than the other flex items

    CSS has several different units for expressing length
    - absolute units:
        - most important: px
        - fixed, meaning not responsive to screen size changes
        - pixels:
            #article-section{
                width: 1200px;
            }
            #side-section{
                width: 400px;
            }
    - Relative units:
        - most important one: %
        - more dynamic
        - oercentage unit: it is relative to the parent container
        - ratio:
            #article-section{
                flex-grow: 2;
            }
            #side-section {
                flex-grow: 1;
            }
    
    Responsive web design:
    - the goal is to make web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes
    - when a website is responsive, it means that it automatically adjusts for different screen sizes

    The auto value:
    - used to center the element within its container
    - the element takes up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the left and right margins
