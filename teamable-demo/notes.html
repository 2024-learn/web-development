    <span> element
    - used to wrap text
    - much like the <p> or <div> element
    Difference:
    - the difference is that these are block elements, whereas span is an inline element
    block level: takes up full width
    inline: Only takes as much width as necessary

    Logical Flow
    - include library in our application
    - use validator  object (as defined in the documentation) to validate the email input
    - the exact logic of validating the email is done in the isEmail() method
    - the function gives the validation result back by returning true or false
    
    Installing npm on mac
    - `brew install node`
    Installing npm on windows:
    - `choco istall -f --force nodejs-lts` or `choco istall -f --force nodejs@v12.34.5` for a specific version

    node_modules
    - packages are put in the ./node_modules folder of the current package root
    - It's just a folder created by npm and a way of tracking each package you install locally
    - the module system is a fudamental part of how node.js applications are written and srtuctured
    - a module is a self-contained file or directory of related code which can be included
    - makes the code more manageable: instead of havong 1 big file, split the code up in separate files

    JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)
    - language-indepedent but heavily uses in JS
    - JSON syntax is a subset of the JS syntax
    - JSON data is written as name/value pairs (aka key-value pairs)
    - in JSON, keys must be strings, written with double quotes {"name": "phyllis"}

    package.json file
    - the heart of any JS project
    - it holds various metadata relevant to the project and used to manage the project's dependencies, scripts, version and more
        Dependencies:
        - dependencies property lists all the required packages and versions for your application to function

    charset attribute
    - specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
    - it is recommended to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of teh characters and symbols in the world
    - others are ASCII, ANSI
    - you can specify it for global as:
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
       <script src="node_modules/validator/validator.min.js"></script>
    or for a specific file as:
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <script charset="utf-8" src="node_modules/validator/validator.min.js"></script>

    Dependencies:
    - You can add a list of libraries with their versions inside the dependencies in package.json,
            {
                "dependencies": {
                "Datepicker.js": "^0.1.1",
                "validator": "^13.7.0",
                "string": "3.3.3",
                "chalk": "5.1.0"
                }
            }
        then you can do run 
            `npm install` 
        on the CLI, without any library name attached and it will install all the modules listed as dependencies in package.json.
    - You can delete a library by removing it from the dependencies and then running `npm install`

    - Using a caret(^) sign, e.g. "Datepicker.js": "^0.1.1", means that we can accept minor and patch releases, 
        but not a major release when updating our package. 
        - If we do not use the ^, then the minor version and patches will both not be updated automatically.(recommended)


    Ignoring node_modules
    - when storing the code in the repo, you don't have to save the node modules. 
        - As long as package.json has the list of dependencies, 
        - allyou have to do to make the code work on any system in the future after downloading the code,
        - is to run an `npm install` and it will dwenload the libraries.

    package-lock.json
    - used to lock dependencies to a specific version number. So it records the last downloaded versions of the libraries in the dependencies file
    - Allows future developers to install the same dependecies with the same exact version in the project
    - Do NOT edit this file manually

    package.json
    - it also holds other meta information about out application. e.g.:
        - name of the application
        - version of the application
            - {
                "name" : "teamable"
                "version": "0.0.1"
                "dependencies": {
                    "Datepicker.js": "0.1.1",
                }
            }
