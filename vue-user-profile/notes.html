<!-- 
Using Vue components instead
    - all HTML code will be written in Vue components in *.vue files
    - vue components are HTML-like files and allow us to encapsulate the view, 
    logic and styling of a component in the same file.
    
Initial structure/setup
    root component - App.vue:
    - parent component of the app containing all child components
    1 index.html:
    - single div element to mount the Vue component interpolation into
    1 main.js:
    - create application instance and mount the Root component into the DOM

Declaring Component's state and bind data with "v-bind"
    "data" function
    - used to declare the reactive state of a componment. Return the initial state
    - it is a JS object that will be made reactive by Vue, when the function is called on creation of the component
    - reactivity: when you modify the value of them, the corresponding view updates

    "v-bind" or ":"
    - one of a number of built-in special attributes(also called directives) that Vue provides
    - Start with the "v-" prefix
        colon ":" is shorthand for "v-bind"
    - dynamically binds it to the corresponding data attribute value
    - reactively apply updates to the DOm when the value of the attribute changes

Declaring Methods and bind with "v-on"
    "methods" function
    - used to add functions to a component instance

    v-on or "@"
    - another built-in special attribute provided by Vue
    - "@" is shorthand for "v-on"
    - attaches an event listener to the element

Declare more reactive state and bind with text interpolation
    attribute bindings                                          text interpolation
    - to bind attributes, we use v-bind, v-on, etc.             - use Mustacne synax to bind the values
    - we can't use Mustache {{ }} syntax
    Both instruct Vue to keep the valies in sync with the defined data attributes

Two-way binding on form inout elements
    2 core features of Vue
    Declarative Rendering
    - vue extends standard HTML with a template syntax that allows us to declaratively describe HTML output based on JS state
    Reactivity
    - vue automatically tracks JS state changes and efficiently updates the DOM when changes happen

    template syntax
    - under the hood, vue compiles the templates into highly-optimzed JS code

    v-model
    - creates a two-way binding
    - it binds the value of the input element to the property od the component's data
    - updates the template whenever the model(data) changes and updates the model whenever the template changes
    - it reduces the complexity of keeping user input consistent with teh application data model
    - we do not need to manually sync the state of the form input with the corresponding state in JS

Toggle element visibility with "v-show"
    v-show
    - Toggle the element visibility depending on if the value is true or false
    -
