<!-- 
Using Vue components instead
   - all HTML code will be written in Vue components in *.vue files
   - vue components are HTML-like files and allow us to encapsulate the view,
   logic and styling of a component in the same file.
  
Initial structure/setup
   root component - App.vue:
   - parent component of the app containing all child components
   1 index.html:
   - single div element to mount the Vue component interpolation into
   1 main.js:
   - create application instance and mount the Root component into the DOM


Declaring Component's state and bind data with "v-bind"
   "data" function
   - used to declare the reactive state of a component. Return the initial state
   - it is a JS object that will be made reactive by Vue, when the function is called on creation of the component
   - reactivity: when you modify the value of them, the corresponding view updates


   "v-bind" or ":"
   - one of a number of built-in special attributes(also called directives) that Vue provides
   - Start with the "v-" prefix
       colon ":" is shorthand for "v-bind"
   - dynamically binds it to the corresponding data attribute value
   - reactively apply updates to the DOM when the value of the attribute changes


Declaring Methods and bind with "v-on"
   "methods" function
   - used to add functions to a component instance


   v-on or "@"
   - another built-in special attribute provided by Vue
   - "@" is shorthand for "v-on"
   - attaches an event listener to the element


Declare more reactive state and bind with text interpolation
   attribute bindings                                          text interpolation
   - to bind attributes, we use v-bind, v-on, etc.             - use Mustache syntax to bind the values
   - we can't use Mustache {{ }} syntax
   Both instruct Vue to keep the values in sync with the defined data attributes


Two-way binding on form input elements
   2 core features of Vue
   Declarative Rendering
   - vue extends standard HTML with a template syntax that allows us to declaratively describe HTML output based on JS state
   Reactivity
   - vue automatically tracks JS state changes and efficiently updates the DOM when changes happen


   template syntax
   - under the hood, vue compiles the templates into highly-optimized JS code


   v-model
   - creates a two-way binding
   - it binds the value of the input element to the property of the component's data
   - updates the template whenever the model(data) changes and updates the model whenever the template changes
   - it reduces the complexity of keeping user input consistent with the application data model
   - we do not need to manually sync the state of the form input with the corresponding state in JS


Toggle element visibility with "v-show"
   v-show
   - Toggle the element visibility depending on if the value is true or false

   - it's common to use "is..." or "has..." variable names for boolean variables
   - in data object, you define the initial values. These values are updated later, based on the changes

   this
   - "this" refers to the (whole object) component instance
   - all data object properties of the component can be accessed with "this"
