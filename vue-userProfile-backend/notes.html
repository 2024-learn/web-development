Develop Backend for vue-user-profile
    - since the front end and the backend are both using javascript, we have two options:
        - share package.json
        - frontend and backend each have tehir own package.json

"serve" command
    - compiles Vue.js into JS
    - starts a dev server

"build" command
    - Produces a production-ready bundle in the /dist directory
    - compiles vue into js and minifies JS/CSS/HTML
        - minification: the process of minimizing code by removing any unnecessary characters, spaces, etc.
        - why: to reduce load times, minified versions reduce file sizes dramatically
    - `npm run build`
    - builds a /dist folder

"start" command
    - starts the application
    - npm run start
    
created()
    - is called when the component instance is created

Application flow
    - created() gets called when App component is created/loaded in the browser
    - calling fetchUserProfile() which makes a HTTP request to the backend on the get-profile endpoint
    - backend sends back the user data, a JS object that contains name, email and interests
    - we set or update the component's state with the user data
    - vue.js automatically updates the view accordingly
