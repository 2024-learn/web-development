Develop Backend for vue-user-profile
   - since the front end and the backend are both using javascript, we have two options:
       - share package.json
       - frontend and backend each have their own package.json


"serve" command
   - compiles Vue.js into JS
   - starts a dev server


"build" command
   - Produces a production-ready bundle in the /dist directory
   - compiles vue into js and minifies JS/CSS/HTML
       - minification: the process of minimizing code by removing any unnecessary characters, spaces, etc.
       - why: to reduce load times, minified versions reduce file sizes dramatically
   - `npm run build`
   - builds a /dist folder


"start" command
   - starts the application
   - npm run start
  
created()
   - is called when the component instance is created


Application flow
   - created() gets called when App component is created/loaded in the browser
   - calling fetchUserProfile() which makes a HTTP request to the backend on the get-profile endpoint
   - backend sends back the user data, a JS object that contains name, email and interests
   - we set or update the component's state with the user data
   - vue.js automatically updates the view accordingly

Connecting Backend to Database


Installation with brew package manager
`brew tap`
   - taps are external sources of homebrew formulae
   - adds another repository to the list of formulae that homebrew tracks, updates and installs from


install mongodb on MacOS:
ref: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/#std-label-install-mdb-community-macos


start mongodb:
`brew services start mongodb-community@7.0`


stop mongodb:
`brew services stop mongodb-community@7.0`


connect to mongodb:
`mongosh`


show existing databases:
`show dbs`


create a different db:
`use <name of new db>`


switch to other db:
`use <name of existing db>`


our app: database:   "company_db"
        collection: "employees"


show collections
`show collections`


   // save payload data to db
   // await collection.insertOne({_id: 1})
   // await collection.insertOne({_id: 2})


find data in a collection
db.collectionname.find()
`db.employees.find()`


MongoDB library
   - the official MongDB driver for node.js


MongoDB Node.js Driver: ref- https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb
   - Allow node.js apps to connect to MongoDB and work with data
   - MongoDB uses a mongodb protocol just as out app uses a http protocol
   - mongodb driver is the intermediary. It acts a translator
   - there are mongodb drivers for different programming languages.
   - mongodb node driver works with Node or JS specifically
       connection URL      mongodb://localhost:27017
       mongodb             the protocol
       localhost           the hostname or IP address
       27017               the port number


create a new mongo client
   - creates a new client that can talk to the Mongo server on the URL we provide
   - we can use that client object to use its methods to connect and interact with the server


unique "_id" field
   - each document stored in a collection requires a unique _id field
   - if not provided, the mongodb driver automatically generates an id for the _id field


insertOne()
   - inserts a single document into a collection
   - it's only for insertion not for updating documents
       await collection.insertOne(payload);
  
deleteOne()
   - removes a single document from a collection
   - {} includes the filter or deletion criteria
   - delete data from a collection, user deleteOne, deleteMany findOneAndDelete or bulkWrite. e.g.
       - `db.employees.deleteOne({ _id: 2})`
       - `db.employees.deleteOne({_id: ObjectId('65874176b8cfebc6c262ba51')})`


updateOne()
   - updates a single document within the collection based on the filter
   - 1st parameter: filter = the selection criteria for the update
   - 2nd parameter: update = the modifications to apply
   - 3rd parameter: upsert = takes a boolean value (optional). if true, updated the document that matches the filter or creates a new document
                             if no documents match the filter.


findOne()
   - returns one document that satisfies the specified query criteria on the collection
   - if multiple documents satisfy the query, the method returns the first document
  
null
   - the value "null" means that no value exists

Test Automation
   Test manually                                         Write Automated tests
   - slow and tedious                                    - save time and more reliable
   - not always accurate due to human error
   - useful for specific type of tests


Writing Automated Tests
test frameworks/libraries
   - facilitate writing and executing tests and reporting test results
   - every programming language and framework has its own test libraries
   - different test types also have different testing frameworks


Types of tests:
   Unit tests
       - simplest test type. easy to write because they are fully isolated
       - testing just one single object or unit
       - important to test different edge cases; not just random values
       - unit tests are cheap to automate and can run very quickly


   Integration tests
       - test dependencies with other systems, like testing a function that calls other functions
       - more complex to test and more expensive to run as they require multiple parts of the application to be up and running
       - integrated with other systems, like database
       - tests that the functions work in combination, e.g. testing the interaction with the database or other services,
           as such these tests are more valuable.


   End to End tests (E2E) ot UI tests
       - test end to end flows, from browser interaction to backend and database
       - E2E tests simulate behavior with the software. Tests the entire software from beginning to end
       - They verify that various user flows work as expected, like logging in
       - verify that the UI is working as expected (UI tests)
       - there are E2E test frameworks for writing such tests. eg. Selenium for JS, puppeteer, etc.


   Performance tests
       - testing the application/website performance under a high load
       - evaluate how a system performs under a particular workload
       - Performance tests simulate these workloads, measuring reliability, speed, scalability, responsiveness


Test Coverage:
   - test coverage is a percentage measure of the degree to which the source code of an application is tested


Add new functionality to our code
   - we are going to test if the email is valid


   logical NOT(!)
       - also called negation
       - takes truth to falsify and vice versa
       - typically used for boolean values: truth becomes false, false becomes true


Different ways of exporting and importing:
   Name Export                                             Name Import
   `export const name = 'value'`                           `import { name } from '....'`


   Default export                                          Default Import
   `export default 'value'`                                `import anyName from '...'`


   Rename Export                                           Rename Import
   `export { name as newName}`                             import { newName } from '...'


   Export List + Rename                                    Import List + Rename
   export {                                                import {
       name1                                                   name1 as newname1
       name2 as newName2                                       newName2
   }                                                       } from '...'


Destructuring:
   - makes it possible to unpack values from properties from objects or arrays into distinct variables e.g.
       const validatorFunctions = require('./validator') into const {isInvalidEmail, isEmptyPayload}


Jest
   - Jest is a popular JS testing framework
   - can also be used for Vue, React, Angular and other JS projects
   - test frontend and backend code with it


   Naming Jest test files
   - you should name your testing files with the same name of the file you want to test plus '.test'. eg. validator.test.js


   1st test case:
   call function with a valid email          we expect "false"


   2nd test case:
   call function with an invalid email        we expect "true"


   How to write a test in Jest
       - jest uses "matchers" to let you test values in different ways
       - there are different matchers available. (.toBe() is the matcher in our case)
       - we want to compare the output of our test with a value we expect the function to return


   - to run the test, insert this in the scripts in the package.json file:
       "test": "jest"
     then on the CLI, run:
     `npm run test`


why unit tests:
   refactoring
       - the process of restructuring code, wile not changing its original functionality
   unit tests help make sure that the code is not broken after refactoring

<!--
Integration tests
Simulate the browser/frontend
   - this is also called "mocking"
   - mock is a method/object that simulates the behavior of a real method/object in controlled ways
   - we need to simulate sending an HTTP request to the backend


   we shall be testing the /update-profile handler
   send invalid payload > Error message
   send correct payload > success message


   - use supertest library. ref: https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest#supertest
